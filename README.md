# classification-challenge

In this challenge we were tasked with completing the notebook file  named 'spam_detector.ipynb'. 
In said notebook we utilized two supervised learning models, Logistic Regression and
Random Forest Classifier. 

Through trials and tribulations, such as determining the proper X and y variables, scaling data, and then
utilizing the two supervised learning models, we were to determine which model was correct.

Originally, I had hypotheisized that the Logistic Regression model would be more accurate, as it did not have the
word 'random' in its model name. However, after completing the challenge, I found that the Random Forest Classifier was more
accurate. This was likely due to the fact it takes data points from multiple variables/trees of information.
